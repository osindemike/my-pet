    <p>My pet animal is a dog. He is called Leo named after my favourite footballer. He is 6 years old and is a German Shepherd. Some of the things that he likes to do include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>jumping in piles of hay</li>
      <li>swimming in the nearby river</li>
      <li>going for long walks in the evening</li>
    </ul>
    <p>His favourite toys are anything that he gets his mouth to and for that reason we keep anything important away from him.</p>
